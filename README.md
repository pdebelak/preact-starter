Preact Starter
==============

A basic preact starter with everything you need and without a bunch of stuff
you might not want.

## What does it have?

I comes with webpack and babel setup to write preact with jsx. It has a
`yarn.lock` file if you want to use yarn, but you can just delete that if you
prefer to use npm directly. It has mocha with jsdom for testing.

## Commands

1. `npm run dev` starts the development server
2. `npm test` runs the tests
3. `npm run build` builds the javascript bundle for production along with the
   contents of the `public` directory into the `build` directory

## How to use

1. Clone this (`git clone git@github.com:pdebelak/preact-starter.git`)
2. Install dependencies `yarn` (or `npm install`)
3. Delete the git repo (`rm -rf .git`)
4. Create your own git repo (`git init`)
5. Start developing!
